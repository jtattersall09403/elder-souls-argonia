# Build progress

Single source of truth for where we are in the build sequence
([world-gen-master-plan.md](world-gen-master-plan.md) §86). Read this file first,
then open only the master-plan sections the active phase needs.

## Protocol (all agents)

1. **Trust the repo over this file.** Before building on a phase marked done,
   spot-check its evidence (run the gates, check `git log`). Before anything
   else, run `git status` — a dirty tree means a previous agent stopped mid-work.
2. **Starting work:** set the phase row to `in progress` with a one-line current
   task, and commit that change before the work itself.
3. **Work in small commits.** Every commit should leave `npm test` and
   `npm run typecheck` green from the repo root.
4. **Finishing a milestone:** flip the row to `done` with one line of evidence,
   in the same commit as the finishing work.
5. **Crash recovery:** if a row says `in progress` but no agent is running, use
   `git status`, `git log -5` and the gates to decide whether to finish, redo or
   revert the partial work; then correct this file.
6. **Keep this file under ~80 lines.** Detail belongs in `docs/decisions/` or
   phase docs, not here. Prune rows for long-finished phases into one line each.

## Waiting on user

- Playtest of migrated combat sandbox after 1a deploys (agent will post instructions).
- Nexus downloads for Phase 2: All Tamriel Heightmap (mod 573) and Tamriel
  Worldspaces Argonia file (mod 118678) into the asset vault.

## Next up

Finish 1a → user playtest gate → 1b (contracts/package extraction) while Phase 2
inputs are awaited.
